I wanted to find out where most of the jobs listed in [Ask HN: Who is hiring? (June 2013)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5803764)
are located.  I'm interested in two data points, which countries and which
cities have the most job ads.

<!--more-->

To gather the data I needed I looked at every comment on the HN post and
manually counted all the countries and cities. If the numbers do not quite add
upp it's because some companies have offices in multiple countries and/or
cities. Since I did it manually there might also be some human errors. I saved
my results in a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At7fRgblU2jzdG4wbW9VZlFSUTBZbTFRX3dqZXlaZlE&usp=sharing)
which is public so anyone can view the raw data.

I also made some charts to visualize the data.
