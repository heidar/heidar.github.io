*Qualitative* data and *quantitative* data refer to different kinds of data and originate from statistics. Both of these types of data can be *subjective* or *objective*. Neither is exclusive to the other.

__Subjectivity__ is used to refer to the condition of being a subject; the quality of a subject's perspective, experiences, feelings, beliefs, and desires.[^1] Subjective information is one person's opinion.[^2]

__Objectivity__ is the idea that scientists, in attempting to uncover truths about the natural world, must aspire to eliminate personal biases, a priori commitments, emotional involvement, etc [^3].

__Qualitative__ data comes from the word quantity, indicating amount. It is a measure of something, number, size, etc.

__Qualitative__ data comes from the word quality. Indicates a description of something. It focuses on the subject's properties, characteristics, features, etc.[^4]

Examples:[^5]  
__Objective, Quantitative__: "The chip speed of my computer is 2 GHz"  
__Subjective, Quantitative__: "On a scale of 1-10, my computer scores 7 in terms of its ease of use"

__Objective, Qualitative__: "Yes, I own a computer"  
__Subjective, Qualitative__: "I think computers are too expensive"
