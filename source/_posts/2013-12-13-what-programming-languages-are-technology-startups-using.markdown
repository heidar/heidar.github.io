Following the popularity of my previous post, [HN Who Is Hiring: Where Are the Jobs?](http://iseld.org/blog/2013/06/03/hn-who-is-hiring-where-are-the-jobs-june-2013),
I wanted to use the Who Is Hiring posts on HN to gather information about what
startups are using in terms of programming languages, frameworks, databases and
so on. In this post I look at the most popular programming languages amongst the
companies that post in the Who Is Hiring posts on HN.

<!--more-->

I gathered the data using three [Ruby scripts](https://github.com/heidar/hnjobs)
that find the Who Is Hiring posts, scrape them for the comments and analyze them.
Feel free to fork the repository and expand it for frameworks,
databases or anything else you can think of. The data is all there for the past
six months in JSON format.

Below are graphs of the most popular programming languages the past six months
including HTML and CSS.
This is only based on the frequencies of these words in the comments of all the
Who Is Hiring posts for each month so it is not completely accurate but
hopefully gives a rough idea about the most popular programming languages amongst
the companies hiring on HN. These are just the raw values, they are not averaged
against the number of comments or anything like that.
